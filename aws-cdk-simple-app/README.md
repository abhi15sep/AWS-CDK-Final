Do you know the "newish" Cloud Development Kit (CDK) from amazon? If not, it's time to learn, and the best place to start is here.

TL;DR: Forget CloudFormation, Terraform, and even Pulumi, why you may ask? To be short and sweet: 

To instantiate a VPC, CDK uses 1 line of code in TypeScript what synthesizes over 450 lines of CloudFormation in JSON. Need more reasons to learn? Keep reading. If you already know CDK is the future and want to learn it, click here.

 


Infrastructure as Code, Master AWS Cloud Development Kit CDK



Release a little over one year ago on reinvented CDK had some big promises to fulfill. Today, after the latest CDK release I finally understand why Amazon is the supreme leader of the cloud market. With a market share equals the sum of its 3 major competitors.




In this course you will create a React website hosted on an S3 bucket and served using CloudFront.

This application will display a collection of photos hosted on another secondary S3 bucket. This bucket is private and has all its contents encrypted.

We will create a Lambda function to generate a private signed URL to the React application to display the photos, and this URLS will be only valid for a short period of time so nobody else can access your photos even if someone try to share the URL.

Want more? We will add an API Gateway to create an endpoint to access the Lambda function directly from our React Application.

And, of course, we will set IAM roles for all of this work together and CloudWatch to monitor the workings of our application.

And we will do all this without spending 1 cent on Amazon services, using only its FREE tear.

I spent almost 4 weeks building this course. During all this time, I have all the services running, and I made a lot of requests for testing, after I was satisfied I destroy all the resources on the cloud and did it all again while recording the course for you, and this was my billing at the end of the month:

$0.00 (zero dollars and zero cents)






But for peace of mind, we will set up billings alerts just in case you forget your app running for 100 years or all your family and friends start checking out your new amazing app.



So what are you waiting to start creating your Infra the same way you write code? Click here (https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-cdk-course/?referralCode=6DA11CA58F11328F8357).



See you on the course,



ps. did I say we will also create tests for the infrastructure as we create unit test for our code, using jest? This course has so  much is just impossible to remember to say everything!
